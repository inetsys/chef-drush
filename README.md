The drush cookbook contains the following lightweight resources:

* [`drush_cmd`](https://github.com/benclark/chef-drush/wiki/drush-Lightweight-Resources#drush_cmd)
* [`drush_variable`](https://github.com/benclark/chef-drush/wiki/drush-Lightweight-Resources#drush_variable)

like drush installed. You may alter the `install_method` and `version`
attributes appropriately.

== Resource/Provider

This cookbook includes LWRP. The +drush_execute+ resource is used to execute a drush command. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run.

=== Syntax

  drush_execute "command" do
    cwd drupal_path
    options %W{views
                stable
                ...
                --use-site-dir=default}
  end

where

* +cwd+ drupal work directory
* +command+ is the name of the command that will be run
* +options+ is zero (or more) of the specific command available options
* +:action+ is the step that the resource will ask the provider to take during the chef-client. +:run+ Default. Indicates that the command should be run or +:nothing+.
